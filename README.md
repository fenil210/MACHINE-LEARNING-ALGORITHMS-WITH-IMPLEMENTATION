# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of various basic machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are implemented in Python and can be used for a variety of tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.

Algorithms Included
The following machine learning algorithms are included in this repository:

1.Linear Regression
2.Decision Trees
3.Random Forests
4.Support Vector Machines (SVM)


Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python module, making it easy to understand and use them individually, along with the csv file used
